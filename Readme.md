## Description

## Project configuration

The How To demos and other projects that depend on the Kastri library have search paths that include an environment variable user override named `Kastri` (appears as `$(Kastri)` in the paths). Either create a user override with the same name which points to your copy of Kastri, or replace the values with the appropriate path.

## Seeking Solutions

There are a number of places you can go to seek solutions. Which place you go to will depend on the solution(s) you seek.

### Embarcadero Quality Portal

The [Quality Portal](https://quality.embarcadero.com) is for reporting issues where you have discovered a problem with Delphi (or other personalities in RAD Studio e.g. C++Builder).

If the issue is related to code in your project, you should include a minimal, compilable, verifiable example. Doing so may reveal whether your code is actually at fault, rather than it being part of the product. 

### Stack Overflow

[Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) is suited if you have code that is not working as you are expecting, and you are looking for help on how to rectify it. You should avoid asking questions of a general nature, including looking for code libraries.

### Delphi Praxis

Delphi Praxis forums have a version for [English](https://en.delphi-praxis.net) speakers, and [German](https://www.delphipraxis.net)

**Please note that Delphi Praxis have been having problems with spammers (as at Dec 2021), so you may need to be patient for your account to be approved.**
