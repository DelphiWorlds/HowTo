# How To

## Description

A collection of demos and code designed to illustrate "how to" do various things, particularly when using the [Kastri library](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri).

Compatible with [Embarcadero](https://wwww.embarcadero.com) [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi)

## Project configuration

Demos and other projects that depend on the Kastri library have search paths that include an environment variable user override named `Kastri` (appears as `$(Kastri)` in the paths). Either create a user override with the same name which points to your copy of Kastri, or replace the values with the appropriate path.
