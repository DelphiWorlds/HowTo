# Phone Demo

## Description

Demonstrates the use of IFMXPhoneDialerService, for making calls, and monitoring the call state

## Project Configuration

The demo uses code from [Kastri](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri), so you will need to either create a User System Override called `Kastri` in the Environment Variable section of the IDE options that points to your copy of the repo, or update the search path in the Project Options.
