# Age Signals demo

## Description

Demonstrates how to use the Age Signals API on Android

## Configuration

### Android

If constructing **your own project** (has already been configured in the demo project), you will need to add the Age Signals library to the Libraries node under the Android 32-bit platform in Project Manager. 

As at 19-DEC-2025, this is: `age-signals-0.0.2.jar` in the ThirdParty/Android folder

To add it to the project, in Project Manager:

1. Expand the Target Platforms
2. Expand Android 32-bit
3. Right-click the Libraries node and click Add..
4. Select the relevant .jar file and click Open

## Notes

**The "real" Age Signals service should be live on Jan 1st, 2026. Until then, it's necessary to use the "fake" API calls, as per the demo**
