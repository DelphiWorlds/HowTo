Q: What might be the maximum amount of code from source code files that someone could publish before it violates copyright? If it differs between countries perhaps base the answer on the US

A:

In the United States, copyright law does not specify a precise amount of source code that can be published without violating copyright. Instead, it operates on principles that can vary depending on the circumstances. Here are the key points to consider:

### 1. **Fair Use Doctrine:**
Under the U.S. copyright law, the fair use doctrine allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission from the rights holders. The following four factors are considered in determining whether a particular use constitutes fair use:

1. **Purpose and Character of Use:**
   - Non-commercial, educational, or transformative uses (such as commentary, criticism, or parody) are more likely to be considered fair use.
   
2. **Nature of the Copyrighted Work:**
   - Published and factual works are more likely to be subject to fair use than unpublished or highly creative works.
   
3. **Amount and Substantiality of the Portion Used:**
   - Using a small portion of the work is more likely to be considered fair use, but the quality of the portion used is also important. Even a small portion can be infringing if it represents the "heart" of the work.

4. **Effect of Use on the Market:**
   - If the use could negatively affect the market for the original work, it is less likely to be considered fair use.

### 2. **De Minimis Use:**
   - This principle suggests that if the amount of code used is so small and insignificant, it might not be considered infringement. However, what constitutes de minimis use can be subjective and context-dependent.

### 3. **Case Law Examples:**
   - Courts have ruled differently in various cases. For example, in *Oracle America, Inc. v. Google, Inc.*, the court had to consider whether Google's use of Java API in Android was fair use. The decision was complex and highlighted the nuanced nature of such determinations.

### 4. **Best Practices:**
   - **Seek Permission:** When in doubt, obtaining permission from the copyright holder is the safest approach.
   - **Use Open Source Licenses:** Consider using code that is available under an open source license that permits the type of use you intend.
   - **Attribute Properly:** Always attribute the source and clarify the terms of use when using someone else's code, especially if it falls under a permissible license.

### 5. **Consult Legal Advice:**
   - Given the complexity and variability of copyright law, consulting with a legal professional who specializes in intellectual property law is advisable when dealing with significant amounts of source code.

### Summary:
While there is no strict word or line limit that universally defines what constitutes copyright infringement in source code, using only a small, non-substantial portion in a way that aligns with fair use principles is generally safer. However, the specific context and use case are crucial in determining whether the use might be considered infringing.
