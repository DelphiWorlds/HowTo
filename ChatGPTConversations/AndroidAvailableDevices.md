Q: In Play Store Console, there is a comparison of how many devices the app will be available for. How is the number of devices determined?

A: The number of devices your app is available for in the Google Play Store Console is determined by a number of factors, primarily related to your app's manifest file (`AndroidManifest.xml`). Here are some factors that determine the availability of your app to different devices:

1. **API Level**: In your `AndroidManifest.xml` file, you specify a `minSdkVersion` and a `targetSdkVersion`. Devices running Android versions outside of this range will not be able to download or install the app.

2. **Screen Sizes and Densities**: If you've specified certain screen size or density requirements (like `small`, `normal`, `large`, `xlarge` for screen sizes or `ldpi`, `mdpi`, `hdpi`, `xhdpi`, etc. for densities), devices that don't match these will be filtered out.

3. **Hardware and Software Features**: Your app might require certain hardware or software features to function. For example, if your app needs a camera, you can specify that in the manifest with `<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera" />`. Devices without a camera would not see the app in the Play Store.

4. **Required Libraries**: If your app relies on certain native libraries (e.g., for ARM or x86 architectures), devices that don't support those libraries won't be able to see or install the app.

5. **Permissions**: Some permissions might inherently imply hardware features. For instance, if you ask for the `CAMERA` permission, it's implied that your app requires a camera, even if you didn't specifically use a `<uses-feature>` tag for the camera.

6. **Country Restrictions**: If you've restricted the availability of your app to certain countries or regions in the Play Console, devices in other regions won't see your app.

7. **Other Device Features**: There are many other device features you can specify in your manifest, like whether the device needs to have a touchscreen, or if it needs to support OpenGL ES of a certain version.

The Play Store uses all these specifications to filter which devices can see and download your app. When you upload a new APK (or App Bundle) to the Play Console, it will analyze these settings and give you an estimated number of compatible devices.

Remember that the actual number of installations will depend on other factors as well, such as app quality, user reviews, and marketing efforts. Also, the ecosystem of Android devices is vast and continually evolving, so the number of compatible devices can change over time as new devices enter the market and old ones become obsolete.
