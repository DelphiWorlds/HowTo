Q: Is it possible to make a request with Google, to allow a Play Store app to be used as the default SMS app?

A: Yes, you can request Google to designate your app as the default SMS app on Android, but there are stringent requirements to fulfill due to the sensitive nature of SMS data. If your app doesn't meet these requirements, it can't be used as the default SMS app.

Here's a brief overview of the process and requirements:

1. **Purpose**: Your app must be designed to be the user's primary texting app. This means that its main purpose should be to send, receive, and manage SMS and MMS messages.

2. **Permissions**: Only the default SMS app is granted the `READ_SMS`, `WRITE_SMS`, `SEND_SMS`, `RECEIVE_SMS`, `RECEIVE_MMS`, and other related permissions. If your app isn't set as the default SMS app, it cannot use these permissions, even if they're declared in the manifest.

3. **Required Features**: Your app needs to support all the essential functionalities an SMS app should have. This includes:

   - Receiving incoming SMS messages.
   - Sending outgoing SMS messages.
   - Reading from and writing to the SMS database.
   - Being the default handler for the "sms:" URI scheme.

4. **User Experience**: The user must have a clear way to set your app as the default SMS app, and it should be a smooth experience. Your app should guide users to the system settings if it's not the default and must provide them with an option to set it as such.

5. **Play Store Declaration**: When submitting your app to the Google Play Store, you will be required to fill out a Permissions Declaration Form. This is where you declare why your app needs particular permissions. Google will review this to ensure that your app's request for SMS permissions aligns with its functionalities and use case.

6. **Privacy & Data Handling**: Because SMS can contain sensitive information, you need to be transparent about data collection and usage. Always ensure that you handle users' data with utmost care and respect their privacy. Complying with the data policies of both Google Play and any local regulations is essential.

7. **Review Process**: Google takes the SMS permissions very seriously, so the review process might be stricter and longer than for other apps. Be prepared to provide additional information or make modifications to your app if required.

8. **Fallback**: If the user removes your app as the default SMS handler, your app should handle this gracefully and inform the user accordingly.

Remember, always keep the user's best interests in mind and provide a secure, transparent, and efficient SMS experience. If Google finds any misuse or mishandling of SMS permissions, your app might be removed from the Play Store or face other penalties.
