# RSP-29435 - TMediaPlayer on Android only plays audio when streaming media and shows wrong duration

## Description

Please refer to [the issue](https://quality.embarcadero.com/browse/RSP-29435) for a description of the problem.

## Comments

No solution at this point, sorry. However, I made a mistake in going down the rabbit hole of why this issue exists, so I am relaying my findings:

The problem ultimately lays in how the `TAndroidVideo` class is implemented in `FMX.Media.Android`. 

When the class is created (by virtue of the fact that the example file is an .mp4, albeit in a URL, rather than a filename), the `CheckVideo` method is called. Since `FileExists` returns false (it's a URL, not a file), `FVideoEnabled` is set depending on whether or not `Control` is assigned, which it cannot be at the time of creation of the `TAndroidVideo` instance, since `Control` is a property that is assigned **after** creation. 

Thus begins the rollercoaster of disaster, since `FVideoEnabled` is `False`, any attempts to do anything video-wise are thwarted. For instance, when `InitInstance` is eventually called as a result of `DoPlay` being called, thus `IsVideoEnabled` is called, since `FVideoEnabled` is `False`, it's assumed that the media is "JustAudio".

At this point, I've reached the rabbit hole's fine print: "Caution: Further tumbling may result in spontaneous tea parties with quantum physicists."

## Alternatives

The VideoView class (which Delphi uses) on Android is considered as a legacy, entry-level option for video playback. If you want to play video (files or URLs) with something more modern, use something that implements ExoPlayer on Android, for example [TVideoPlayer in Kastri](https://github.com/DelphiWorlds/Kastri/tree/master/Demos/VideoPlayer), or [the one from Alcinoe](https://github.com/MagicFoundation/Alcinoe?tab=readme-ov-file#video-player-for-firemonkey)
