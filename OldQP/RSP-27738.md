# RSP-27738 - Linker errors when compiling against TurboActivate static library on macOS 64

## Description

Please refer to [the issue](https://quality.embarcadero.com/browse/RSP-27738) for a description of the problem.

## Solution

From the moment this was reported, it may have been resolvable without any changes to Delphi. Regardless, this is what works in at least Delphi 13:

* In Delphi's SDK Manager, for macOS:
  1. Select one of the entries in the `Library Paths` section
  2. Click the `Add` button
  3. In `Path on remote machine`, enter:
     `$(SDKROOT)/usr/lib`
  4. In `File mask` enter:
     `libcurl`
  5. Click `OK`
  6. Click `Update Local File Cache` - respond to any prompts with `Yes To All`
  7. Click `Save`
* Add `Macapi.IOKit` to the implementation uses clause in `Macapi.TurboActivate.pas`
* In Project Options > Building > Delphi Compiler > Linking, modify the `Options passed to the LD linker` value to:
  `-lc++ -lcurl`
  This informs the linker that the code is dependent on `libc++` and `libcurl`
